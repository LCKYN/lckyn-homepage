# 🚧 LCKYN Landing Page

> *"If you get some bug, you get some bug"* - Albert Einstein (never said)

## What's This?

A stylish "under maintenance" landing page that's actually just a fancy redirect hub. Because sometimes the best landing page is the one that admits it's not ready yet. 🎭

This repo contains the landing page for **lckyn.com** - a modern, animated maintenance page that gracefully redirects visitors to all the important stuff while the main site is getting its glow-up.

## Quick Links Hub

Instead of a traditional landing page, this acts as a central hub directing visitors to:

- 📄 **Resume** → `resume.lckyn.com` (HTML version because LaTeX is overrated)
- 📋 **Resume PDF** → `resume-pdf.lckyn.com` (For the traditional folks)
- 💻 **GitHub** → `github.lckyn.com` (Where the magic happens)
- 💼 **LinkedIn** → `linkedin.lckyn.com` (Professional networking theater)
- ✉️ **Email** → `T.Pawarit@lckyn.com` (Direct line to my inbox)
- 🎨 **Portfolio** → `portfolio.lckyn.com` (🚧 WIP - Rome wasn't built in a day)

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - The foundation
- **CSS3** - All the pretty stuff
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Because sometimes simple is better
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting FTW
- **Custom Domain** - Because `.github.io` is so 2020

## Philosophy

> *"A landing page should be like a good joke - if you have to explain it, it's probably not working."* - Anonymous Web Developer

This page follows the principle of elegant simplicity: tell users what they need to know, give them what they want, and get out of their way. No complex navigation, no overwhelming content, just clean design and clear pathways to the good stuff.

## Contributing

Found a bug? Want to make it even more unnecessarily animated? PRs welcome! 

Just remember: 
- Keep it clean
- Keep it fast  
- Keep it accessible
- Add more gradients (just kidding... or am I?)

## License

MIT License - Use it, abuse it, just don't blame me if your users get hypnotized by the floating particles.
